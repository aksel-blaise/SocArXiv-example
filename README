INTRODUCTION
---------------------
The (unofficial) SocArXiv LaTex Template is a work-in-progress based on the 
  official latex template of the Journal of Statistical Software by
  Achim Zeileis. Please refer to JSS.pdf for details on sa.cls arguments. 
  Additional SocArXiv logos and graphics can be found at:  https://osf.io/zgcqv/

REQUIREMENTS
---------------------
This template is intended to be used with LaTex, pdflatex, and latex2e. Other
 compilers may or may not work. This template has been tested on an stable
 version of Scientific Linux SL6 (2.6.32-573.12.1.el6.x86_64) on pdflatex, 
 OS X 10.11  ``El Capitan" on MacTex, and MS Windows 7 (SP1 6.1-KB976932-X64) 
 on MikTex. For specific libraries and dependencies, please see the JSS template
